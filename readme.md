## MiniAspire - Laravel Project

The project focuses on creating a mini version of Aspire so that the candidate can think about the systems and architecture the real project would have.

The task is defined below:

 - Build a simple API that allows to handle user loans.
 - Necessary entities will have to be (but not limited to): users, loans, and repayments.
 - The API should allow simple use cases, which include (but are not limited to): creating a new user, creating a new loan for a user, with different attributes (e.g. duration, repayment frequency, interest rate, arrangement fee, etc.), and allowing a user to make repayments for the loan.
 - The app logic should figure out and not allow obvious errors. For example a user cannot make a repayment for a loan thatâ€™s already been repaid.
